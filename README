Std C G1A-Wrapper v1.0
---------------------------

c_g1awrapper is a tiny command line tool which add the Casio's G1A file
header into a binary file, to see it as a Casio addin.
This program is a portage of the g1awrapper written by Andreas Bertheussen,
which is in C++/Qt. This one doesn't need any external library such as Qt,
so it's smaller and easier to build and port than the original g1awrapper.
